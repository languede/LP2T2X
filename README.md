## Note for the team:
**For MacOS user:**  
Please type `exec bash` in mac's terminal to switch default shall to `bash`,  
That is:   
         1.  ~ > `exec bash`  // switch to bash shell  
         2.  bash >   // we are now using bash as our default shell   
         3.  bash > `pip3 install django-phonenumber-field[phonenumberslite]`   
         4.  bash > `pip3 install django-simple-history`  
         5.  bash > `pip3 install pyzbar opencv-python` 
         6.  bash > `pip3 install pillow`  
         7.  bash > `exec zsh` // back to zsh shell    
         8. to run the code:   
                  direct to manage.py , type: python3 manage.py runserver
